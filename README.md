# CAOS_Hardware_Security

Developed and simulated a compiler tailored for CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme, emphasizing the significance of encrypted computing.

Implemented vector additions, multiplications, and rotations leveraging the CKKS scheme.

Enhanced scheme efficiency by applying re-linearization and rescaling techniques via the Residue Number System and Chinese Remainder Theorem.
